# Config file for the character finder:
#
# <default> line sets the default override if at least a name is given
# the other entries will be constructed using the default entry
#
# Tokens: Entries must be enclosed in <>, dice-types must be enclosed in []
#	Dice are assumed to start at 1. For a die ranging from 0 to 9 use '<dice:[1d10-1]>'
#	Examples for dice tokens are: <dice:[2d10+2]> is equivalen to <dice:[1d10+2][1d10]> is equivalent to <dice:[1d10+1][1d10+1]>
#	Dice tokens consistin only of flat values like +3 are not supported: <dice:[+3]> e.g. is illegal
#	if you want no randomness you can hack this by using 0 dice like e.g. <dice:[0d10+3]>
#
# Default entries are parsed when they encountered and set the default for all following lines.
#
# '#' marks line as comment. It only marks the line as comment if it is the first non-whitespace character.
		 # so this is fine for example
